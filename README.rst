trm.doppler is a Python implementation of Doppler tomography.

Pre-requisites for installation:

C++ libraries:

  fftw    -- for taking FFTs, standard package.
  cpp-mem -- my translation of memsys into C++.

Python:
  astropy

Some scripts need other packages. e.g. The volume rendering script
vrend.py needs 's2plot'
