Doppler tomography background
=============================

Our view of binary stars is complicated by their orbital motion. Were we fixed
within the rotating frame of the binary, we would have a fixed view, but from
our near-inertial external perspective only the centre of mass remains at
constant velocity with respect to us. All other points are seen to move away
from us for half the orbit and approach for the other half. Given the Doppler
effect, a region of strong emission will produce a feature in line profiles
which varies sinsuoidally. This is seen as a sinusoidal "S-wave" in stacked
plots of spectra ("trailed spectra"). The essential work of Doppler tomography
is to associate such S-waves with single fixed points in an image or map of
the system.
