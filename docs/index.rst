   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to trm.doppler's documentation!
=======================================

trm.doppler is a Python package for carrying out Doppler tomography. It is
based around the principles described in Marsh & Horne (1988) but is
considerably generalised beyond the code used for that paper. Above all
perhaps, a Python implementation allows easy access to the results with the
full power of Python's analysis and graphics capabilities at hand. A core
principle of trm.doppler is the use of the familiar FITS format for all input
and output (apart from some ASCII configuration files). This should make it
relatively easy  to access.
