# image sections. Each image requires the following:
#
# nxy    : number of pixels on a side in Vx-Vy plane
# nz     : number of Vz slice
# vxy    : km/s/pixel in Vx-Vy plane
# vz     : km/s/slice in Vz direction
# back   : background value to set image to.
# default: default to use (Uniform, Gaussian)
# fwhmxy : if Gaussian, this is FWHM, km/s,to use in X-Y plane
# fwhmz  : if Gaussian, this is FWHM, km/s, to use in Z (ignored if nz == 1)
# wave1  : wavelength of first line associated with the image
# gamma1 : systemic velocity, km/s, of first line associated with the image
# scale1 : scale factor of first line associated with the image [ignored
#          if only one wavelength]
# wave2  : wavelength of second line associated with the image
# gamma2 : systemic velocity, km/s, of second line associated with the image
# scale2 : scale factor of second line associated with the image
# wave3  : ... repeat as desired ...
