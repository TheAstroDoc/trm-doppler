# image sections. Each image requires the following:
#
# nxy    : number of pixels on a side in Vx-Vy plane
# nz     : number of Vz slice
# vxy    : km/s/pixel in Vx-Vy plane
# vz     : km/s/slice in Vz direction
# back   : background value to set image to.
# default: default to use (Uniform, Gaussian)
# fwhmxy : if Gaussian, this is FWHM, km/s,to use in X-Y plane
# fwhmz  : if Gaussian, this is FWHM, km/s, to use in Z (ignored if nz == 1)
# wave1  : wavelength of first line associated with the image
# gamma1 : systemic velocity, km/s, of first line associated with the image
# scale1 : scale factor of first line associated with the image [ignored
#          if only one wavelength]
# wave2  : wavelength of second line associated with the image
# gamma2 : systemic velocity, km/s, of second line associated with the image
# scale2 : scale factor of second line associated with the image
# wave3  : ... repeat as desired ...

# Next sections are optional. They allow the addition of spots and discs to
# make something more interesting than a constant.
#
# Spots: These are gaussian in velocity space. A section like [spot1_2] means
# the second spot for the first image.  Each spot is defined by:
#
# vx     : centre of spot in Vx
# vy     : centre of spot in Vy
# vz     : centre of spot in Vz (ignored if nz == 1)
# fwhm   : FWHM width parameter
# height : height.
#
# NB not every image has to have a spot, so you could just start with spot2_1
# for example. Spots for non-existent images, e.g. spot3_1 here, will be
# ignored, as will non-sequential spots such as an isolated spot2_5

# Discs: discs are defined by a centre of symmetry in Vx-Vy, a plane of
# symmetry in Vz, a velocity of peak intensity, the intensity at peak, and
# outer and inner power law exponents to define how the intensity changes away
# from the peak. i.e. for v > vpeak, the intensity scales as
# (v/vpeak)**eout. In the Vz direction the disc is gaussian.
#
# Each disc requires:
#
# vx    : centre of symmetry in Vx
# vy    : centre of symmetry in Vy
# vz    : centre of symmetry in Vz (only if nz > 1)
# fwhmz : FWHM in Vz (only if nz > 1)
# vpeak : velocity of peak (outer disc velocity)
# ipeak : intensity per pixel at peak
# eout  : outer power law exponent
# ein   : inner power law exponent
